Welcome to the coziest corner of the world wide web:  __*Literati*__.  This full stack web application allows users to leverage the power that web-based technologies can bring to their literary life.  It was created using the Model View Controller paradigm to separate the user interface from database interactions, while the controller is calling the shots by ensuring all requests are routed to the appropriate functions.
